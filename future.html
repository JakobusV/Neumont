              Where to start? Well, I'm entering my senior year soon and I've been thinking about switching schools. That's something that's still in the air though because, there's no big push 
              for me to do it. But beyond just high school is where it really can get fuzzy because there's two collages I'm looking at right now. One could be more convinent but less focused 
              what really I want to go into. And another with direct focus on what I want to become but the entry could be challenging. Either way, I'm going to be ready to push myself when 
              I really need to.

              For things outside of class work and anything school related thought, there's some action being put into motion. As of writing this I'm about to apply at a story near by my 
              house. And it's a great place for multiple reasons beyond that, it pays well, there's people I know working there, and the management isn't hard on the workers. This will be 
              my first job, I'm excited to see if they take me and I hope for the best.
