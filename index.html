      <p>Hello and Welcome to my site, This project is for my 2019 Summer Scholars class. (Pretty cool right?)</p>

        My name is Jakob Vanderniet. I'm 17, I like to play video games, and hangout with my friends. I'm the 6 foot funny guy with the long girly hair and no, I don't plan on cutting it any 
        time soon. I was born and raised in Utah, and I really enjoy living here. I always like learning new things, and recently I've been trying to learn the electric guitar. I listen to a 
        lot of Alt-Rock and that influence made me want to pick it up and play.

        To navigate this site, use the links at the top to travel between pages. There's three other pages to check out and the names are pretty self explanatory. Interests will be things I 
        like, favorite sites are places I find myself frequently visiting, and future plans is where I see myself later on down the road.
