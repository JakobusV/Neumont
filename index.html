    <h1>Welcome To The Homepage</h1>

      <p>Hello and Welcome to my site, This project is for my 2019 Summer Scholars class. (Pretty cool right?)</p>

        My name is Jakob Vanderniet. I'm 17, I like to play video games, and hangout with my friends. <q>I'm the 6 foot funny guy with the long girly hair and no, I don't plan on cutting it any 
        time soon.</q> I was born and raised in Utah, and I <em>really</em> enjoy living here. I always like learning new things, and recently I've been trying to learn the electric guitar. I listen to a 
        lot of Alt-Rock and that influence made me want to pick it up and play.

        <strong>To navigate this site</strong>, use the links at the top to travel between pages. There's three other pages to check out and the names are pretty self explanatory. Interests will be things I 
        like, favorite sites are places I find myself frequently visiting, and future plans is where I see myself later on down the road. <strong>To alter layout, change the CSS link from 'main2.css' to 
        'main.css' in the inspect element.</strong>
