    <h1>Here's a List of Things I Enjoy!</h1>
    <section>
      <p>First of all, I'd like to get the games out of the way. I've been playing video games my whole life and they have influenced me in more ways than one, for better or worse. I started 
        out just watching my sibliings play games like Super Mario and Halo. But once I finally got the controller in my hands, I was hooked. The great part about having those older siblings 
        is that I got those old games once they were tired of playing them. I would end up spending way too much time on those old systems, just exploring all these new worlds, and meeting 
        plenty of unique characters.

      <p>
        But when I'm not staying inside playing games, I'm often out hanging out with my close friends. I wouldn't say I have a large amount of friends but the ones I do have are so great. 
        They all have at least something in common with me so being with them never feels boring or weird at all. We like to spend our time playing <strong>Super Smash Brothers</strong> and 
        roaming around Sugarhouse looking for good places to go and eat at.

        Something else I like to spend my time doing is longboarding. I really enjoy longboarding because it's the closest thing I can get to surfing when I'm away from the water. I have a 
        couple good spots near my house that can be a pretty fun, I don't really go too hardcore most the time though.
