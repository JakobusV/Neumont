    <h1>Here's a List of Things I Enjoy!</h1>

      <p>First of all, I'd like to get the games out of the way. I've been playing video games my whole life and they have influenced me in more ways than one, for better or worse. I started 
        out just watching my sibliings play games like Super Mario and Halo. But once I finally got the controller in my hands, I was hooked. The great part about having those older siblings 
        is that I got those old games once they were tired of playing them. I would end up spending way too much time on those old systems, just exploring all these new worlds, and meeting 
        plenty of unique characters.

      I really enjoy coding, (when it works of course). I started learning to code around 9th grade in a basic computer science class. As the class went on, I found myself picking up on the 
      material very well and feel very comfortable using it.
